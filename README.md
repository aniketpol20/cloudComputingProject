# CloudComputingProject
Project aims to implement a user friendly web-portal which will be used to monitor and manage cloud resources  
using RESTful APIâ€™s. It requires setting up a private cloud environment on a virtual machine, understanding core 
services provided by the OpenStack to monitor and manage instances such as keystone for authentication, nova for  
computational etc. OpenStack Java SDK (openstack4j) will be used to communicate with the cloud platform. Resource  
usage data provided by the OpenStack will be displayed in the graphical form on web portal.

Technologgies Used:                                                                                                                       
[1] Cloud Environment is setup using openstack cloud platform                                                                           
[2] OpenStack4j SDk is used to communicate with the cloud plaform to get the resource information and for authentication 
    purpose           
[3] RestFul API's are provided using Java Spring MVC framework                                                                             
[4] Dashboard is implemented using JavaScript and bootstrap
